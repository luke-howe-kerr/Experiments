C++ Notes from the 12-14-2013 meeting

C++ Notes:
- to exit a git commit message, press ctrl x - ctrl s (save) -- ctrl x - ctrl c (exit)
- to compile in terminal -- g++ main.cpp -o main -g
          -o names the output file "main"
	  -g includes all the information for the debugger

Emacs Notes:
- ctrl x - ctrl f (open file)
- ctrl x - b (switch buffer)
- ctrl x - 2 (split frames)
- ctrl x - 1 (one frame)
- ctrl x - o (go to next frame)
- ctrl g (quit current command)
- option w (copy)
- ctrl y (paste)

C++ homework:
- use GetPositiveDouble wherever necessary
- use ask-if-yes wherever relevant
- *fix the math bug with the total register cash
- create a GetNonEmptyString function and apply wherever necessary
- have an optional gift message per item
- cin only picks up the first word with strings - FIX!
- truncate the tax to two decimal places
- what does hci stand for
- ask Mr. Baar about the research question

- design and run several experiments to determine distance from the
raspberry pi that the iPhones will be detected
	  - line of sight distance tests
	    	 - 0, 5, 10, etc. until it cannot be detected anymore
	  - same as above but with different orientations of the Pi
	  (all 4)
	  - test different heights
	  - repeat line of sight through wall - move both the phone
	  and the Pi
	  - figure out materials of the walls we are testing
	  - inside and outside - different locations (doors, windows,
	  walls, etc.)
	  - types of data:
	    	  - signal strength
	  	  - only ID specific phones
	  
	  - motion tests
	    	   - start out of range and walk within 1 ft of it
		   - repeat for 5ft, 10ft, etc. until it cannot be detected
		     	    	- in a large open space
		   - repeat in-home

	  - upstairs vs. downstairs
